# Slack To PDF Report - Jimmy's Add-On

My fork of thundergolfer's slack to pdf report. I'm going to work on making it look a lot nicer.

## Overview

`slack-to-pdf` is best used to report the team interactions on Slack for a University/College assignment. Some group project assignments require you do log and present your communications to assess member contribution.

`slack-to-pdf` can be used locally on one machine for yourself to explore an export or it can be run on a headless server (as it is a Flask web app) if you also want to serve the content to the rest of your team.
